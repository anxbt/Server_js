This project provides an interactive command-line interface (CLI) to help you quickly set up an Express.js application with your desired dependencies and boilerplate files. It's inspired by tools like create-react-app.

## Features

- Guides you through the initial project setup by prompting for essential project details and dependencies.
- Creates a project directory with chosen dependencies installed (using npm).
- Generates basic boilerplate files like `package.json` and potentially a server file (`server.js`).

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/interactive-express-app-generator.git
```

## Install Dependencies
### Navigate to the project directory and run:

```npm install```

```nodemon index3.js```
The script will prompt you for your project name and desired dependencies like Express.js, Nodemon, Mongoose (for MongoDB), and the MongoDB driver.

Project Creation
Based on your choices, the script will create a new project directory, install chosen dependencies, and generate necessary files.

## Usage
### The script currently prompts for the following dependencies (you can customize this in index.js):

- Express.js
- Nodemon (for development)
- Mongoose (for MongoDB)
- MongoDB
